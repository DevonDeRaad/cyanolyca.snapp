These are the output files from our SNAPP run. 'all.rep1.xml' and 'all.rep2.xml' are the BEAST2 input files to run the two independent MCMC chains. The bash script used to run BEAST2 on the KU HPCC is called 'run.all.snapp.sh'. The output log files detailing each run are called 'rep1.all.log' and 'rep2.all.log'. The output tree files are called 'rep1.all.trees' and 'rep2.all.trees'. The slurm output files begin with the prefix 'slurm'. 'alltips.combinedruns.trees' is the output of logcombiner, containing 8K trees sampled from the posterior of both independent MCMC chains after discarding the first 1M generations of each chain as burn-in. 'alltips.combinedruns.con.tree' is the maximum clade credibility tree output from TreeAnnotator using the aforementioned 8K trees sampled from the posterior distribution of both chains as input. 'tracer.output.png' shows our visual assessment of convergence. 'all.combinedruns.consensus.tree.png' shows the consensus tree with posterior probabilites labeled on each internal branch. 'densitree.rootcanal.png' and 'densitree.png' show all 8K posterior species trees overlaid with and without the consensus tree denoted in bold.
